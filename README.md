Earth System Framework Description Language

A git repository for version control of ES-FDL mind maps.

To get started, you'll need the FreeMind application, 
which is available for download here:

http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Download

There are currently two top level folders:
 
 - coupled-system --> the active set of mindmaps; an organization from the perspective 
                      of an entire coupled system; international collaboration
 
 - archive --> contains archived versions of mindmaps, no longer active
 
 --- original (archived) --> contains the initial es-fdl mindmaps from Cecelia and Rocky
   (update 3/31/14) - updated with additional changes from Cecelia and Rocky
   (completed before boulder-workshop and coupled-system versions)
 
 --- boulder-workshop (archived) --> the es-fdl mindmaps + additions from the tables generated
   by participants at the coupling workshop held in Boulder, February 2013
