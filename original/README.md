Earth System Framework Description Language

A git repository for version control of ES-FDL mind maps.

To get started, you'll need the FreeMind application, 
which is available for download here:

http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Download

Then, open up the quick-start-template.mm file to see an
small mind map describing conventions used to facilitate
collaboration among those of us working on the mind maps.
